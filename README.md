# Buchanan Interview: Code Challenge

## Instructions 

### Create a Laravel application that communicates with a public API (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) in order to retrieve data and display it on a dedicated ‘Beers’ page.

#### The Application should meet the following requirements:

- All users of the application must register and authenticate.
- The ‘Beers’ page should allow users to generate 5 random beers available through the API - showing a bit of information on each (i.e. name, abv, etc).
- Users must be +18 in order to access the ‘Beers’ page.

#### Notes:

 - We recommend the use of sqlite as a database engine.
 - This project has Laravel Sail installed to get started quickly. If you have permissions issues running it, delete the vendor folder and recreate it using the following command:

 ```
 composer install
 ```
